When you have made some edits to your project and you want to see what it looks like after you publish it, you can select the [Preview](/user-manual/publication/preview-your-project) function to view it. When you think the project is almost edited and ready to be published for everyone to experience, you can use the [Publish](/user-manual/publication/set-up-the-project-for-publication) function.

## Preview your project

On the right side of the header of the Editor, there are two buttons related to the publishing function. Click the first Preview button, and the browser will automatically open a new note page for you.

<Image path={require('./img/7-1.png').default} />

In this new tab, you can see what your project will look like after it is released. The only difference from a real project release is that this page is only visible to you (or team members), so you can come and preview your project anytime without any worries.

## Publish your project

It's also very easy to publish your project.

<Image path={require('./img/7-2.png').default} />
<Image path={require('./img/7-3.png').default} />
<Image path={require('./img/7-4.png').default} />

<Order>
  <ListByNumber>
    Click the unpublished button in the upper right corner of the Editor, and click Publish in the drop-down menu.
  </ListByNumber>
  <ListByNumber>
    After confirming the information in the pop-up model, click Publish.
  </ListByNumber>
  <ListByNumber>
    After successfully publishing, you can open your project directly by clicking the url.
  </ListByNumber>
</Order>

At this time, you can copy your project url to your friends and let them check out your project.

There are many more details about publishing projects, you can check them in [Publish](http://localhost:3000/user-manual/publication/overview) section.
