## Archive your project

When you are making more and more projects, and some projects have come to an end, and you will not modify them for the time being, you can archive these projects.

The archive operation will not delete the project data, it will only turn it into read-only mode. When you want to modify the project again, just release the project from the archive mode.

In the danger zone at the bottom of the setting page, you can find the archive operation button.
