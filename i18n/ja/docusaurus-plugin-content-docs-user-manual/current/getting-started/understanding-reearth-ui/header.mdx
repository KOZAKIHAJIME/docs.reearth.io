title: Header
sidebar_position: 2

The Header is mainly responsible for navigation, but also for quickly completing some functions, such as publishing projects and so on. Header is present on every page of RE:Earth. However, the functions available in the Header vary slightly from page to page. Because the header of the Editor page has full features, we take it as an example here.
